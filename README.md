# 124_W19
Class code from the Winter 2019 CPTR 124 Fundamentals of Programming course

The code in this repository represents C++ code developed interactively during class.
It is not organized for external use, nor is it meant to used for instructional purposes
apart from the experiences within the course itself.  
The design of some of the code is student-driven, and some is experimental.  
The purpose of some of the examples is to demonstate poor coding practice, with better
practice appearing elsewhere within the repository (perhaps even in a different example).
